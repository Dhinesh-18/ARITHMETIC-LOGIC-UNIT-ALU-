DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW: This project involves designing a Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that supports the following operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
AND (&)
OR (|)
NOT (~)
The ALU is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and includes a testbench for validation. A simulation report is also provided to demonstrate the correctness of the design.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: Implement the ALU using Verilog/VHDL. Design a testbench to validate functionality. Simulate the ALU and generate a report. DELIVERABLES: ✅ ALU Verilog/VHDL Code ✅ Testbench for Verification ✅ Simulation Report
